I am a fifth-year graduate student in [the Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu) at Harvard University. My research interests are in experimental syntax and semantics, in particular the mapping between the two. I work on the semantics of bare nouns in Russian and its interface with the syntax of the DP-level in Russian. My experimental work is executed in the [Meaning & Modality Laboratory](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/meaningandmodality/home). I am especially interested in the methodology aspect of experimental human-centered research. 

I come from a fieldwork background, and I previously I worked with Uralic and Turkic languages spoken in Russia, namely, with Moksha and Erzya Mordvin, Hill Mari, Northern Khanty, and Chuvash. The topics I have worked on in the field include differential subject marking, syntax and semantics of non-finite embedded clauses, and agreement systems. I am also a member of the I am an Associate at the [Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies](https://daviscenter.fas.harvard.edu) at Harvard University. 

Before going to Harvard, I received a BA from [the Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics
](http://tipl.philol.msu.ru) at Moscow State University and an MA in [Linguistic Theory and Language Description](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/tling/) from Higher School of Economics (Moscow).

My name is pronounced as ['darʲjə 'bʲikʲɪnə]. However, most Russians have full names used in "official" situations and nicknames used elsewhere, so I also go by Dasha. My pronouns are she/her.
