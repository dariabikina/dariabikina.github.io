I am a second-year graduate student in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University. My primary interests are in syntax and semantics, in particular the mapping between these two interfaces. The topics I have been thinking lately are semantics of bare arguments, differential subject marking, syntax and semantics of non-finite embedded clauses, and agreement systems. I also love doing fieldwork. I have been working with Uralic and Turkic languages spoken in Russia, namely, with Moksha and Erzya Mordvin, Hill Mari, Northern Khanty, and Chuvash. I also do some work on Russian.

Before going to Harvard, I received a BA from the Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at Moscow State University and a MA in Linguistic Theory and Language Description at HSE (Moscow).

My name is pronounced as ['darʲjə 'bʲikʲɪnə]. However, most Russians have full names used in "official" situations and nicknames used elsewhere, so I also go by Dasha.

You can reach me at dbikina at g dot harvard dot edu.
