I am a second-year graduate student in [the Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu) at Harvard University. My primary interests are in syntax and semantics, in particular the mapping between these two interfaces. The topics I have been thinking lately are semantics of bare arguments, differential subject marking, syntax and semantics of non-finite embedded clauses, and agreement systems. I also love doing fieldwork. I have been working with Uralic and Turkic languages spoken in Russia, namely, with Moksha and Erzya Mordvin, Hill Mari, Northern Khanty, and Chuvash. I also do some work on Russian. 

I am an Associate at the [Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies](https://daviscenter.fas.harvard.edu) at Harvard University. 

Before going to Harvard, I received a BA from [the Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics
](http://tipl.philol.msu.ru) at Moscow State University and an MA in [Linguistic Theory and Language Description](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/tling/) from Higher School of Economics (Moscow).

My name is pronounced as ['darʲjə 'bʲikʲɪnə]. However, most Russians have full names used in "official" situations and nicknames used elsewhere, so I also go by Dasha. My pronouns are she/her. 

You can reach me at **dbikina at g dot harvard dot edu**. Some of my work can also be found on my [Github](https://github.com/dariabikina).
